First, we need a website that we want to monitor first

I choose [OWASP JUICE SHOP](https://demo.owasp-juice.shop/#/)

At `Proxy`, go to the `option` tab

And you see that Burp has a proxy listener which is used to receive incoming HTTP requests from your browser

Click on `import/export CA certificate`

Click on `Certificate in DER format`

Choose `next` -> `select file` -> create a file and just make sure it has a `der` ending
